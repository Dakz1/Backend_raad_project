# Project Lap Two ReadMe

Installation & usage:
To run the app locally, we are using docker, therefore make sure to have docker desktop running.
Once you do you can run in the terminal from the api folder docker-compose up.
Please make sure to run docker-compose down when moving on to the test. 
Once the api server is running then open live server on the front end.
        
## Changelog:
Tried to implement the week field as an object with seven different days but didn't work so we resorted to a counter that increments by one 
        
## Bugs
Issues with testing with multiple error codes like .close is not defined request is not defined 

## Could have:
Added statistics and quotes and made it so that any user that logs in has specific habits just for them 
rather than being accessible by other users 

# Wins & Challenges
Correctly encrypting passwords 
Connecting to db and displaying data to db
